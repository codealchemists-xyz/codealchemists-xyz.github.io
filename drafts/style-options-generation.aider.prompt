Improve the style of the website in index.html. We would like to maintain a software engineer / crypto / hacker vibe.

# TASK: Provide a set of 7 different examples from which we can choose the best style.

# SPECIFICATION (SPEC): maintain (at least some) consistency with our business cards that use these colors:
```latex
\definecolor{primarycolor}{RGB}{0,255,0}  % Green
\definecolor{secondarycolor}{RGB}{0,200,0}  % Darker Green
\definecolor{accentcolor}{RGB}{0,150,0}  % Even Darker Green
\definecolor{backgroundcolor}{RGB}{0,0,0}  % Black
```latex

# SPEC: For every draft copy the results to `drafts/{draft_number}/index.html`

# SPEC: For every draft, add an entry to `drafts/README.md` describing the style changes of the current revision.

# SPEC: Do not commit changes to the original `index.html`. Only commit the files in `drafts`
